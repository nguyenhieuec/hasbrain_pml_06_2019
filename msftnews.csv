0,"Ivy League institutions like Harvard, Yale and Princeton come with prestige — but they also come with a hefty sticker price.

At Yale, tuition alone for the 2019-2020 school year is $55,500. After tacking on expenses like room and board, it costs nearly $76,000 to attend. That's before factoring in any grants, scholarships or financial aid that students may receive.

If attending a ""big name"" school means you're going to wind up with a lot of student loan debt, it may not be worth it, says self-made billionaire Mark Cuban: ""There isn't a lot of value add from big name schools for freshman or sophomore classes, particularly when a motivated student can augment their studies with free online courses from the big names,"" he tweeted this week.

At the end of the day, whether you're considering an Ivy or not, ""the most important criteria when choosing a college is affordability,"" the tech entrepreneur said. ""Go to a school you can afford. A community college that offers transferable credits is always smart.""

Cuban, now 60, started college at the University of Pittsburgh but transferred to Indiana University after his freshman year. He picked IU's Kelley School of Business without ever seeing the campus because it had the cheapest tuition among the top 10 business programs at the time, according to the school's website.

At Indiana, he worked various jobs, from giving dance lessons to hosting disco parties, to help pay for his tuition.","['lot', 'schools', 'arent', 'school', 'youre', 'college', 'mark', 'big', 'tuition', 'yale', 'worth', 'cuban', 'university', 'student', 'colleges', 'priceheres']","Ivy League institutions like Harvard, Yale and Princeton come with prestige — but they also come with a hefty sticker price.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.80% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 1, 2019. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

3,"Microsoft wants to create a safe space for gaming discussions

Microsoft (MSFT) is aiming to moderate content that people post to its Xbox Live platform, in an apparent attempt to keep its gaming business out of trouble. Xbox Live, which has more than 60 million monthly active users, allows users to post comments as they discuss games. However, that feature exposes the platform to the risk of people posting hateful content, which could pose problems for Microsoft with the public and regulators. Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are under pressure from regulators around the world to remove bad content from their platforms, such as misleading articles or hateful posts. Microsoft is set to begin rolling out Xbox Live content moderation tools in the coming months, according to CNBC.

Microsoft’s gaming revenue jumps 5.0%

Microsoft’s gaming revenue increased 5.0% year-over-year in the March quarter, driven by strong software and service sales. One of the world’s top gaming companies, Microsoft had $9.8 billion in gaming sales last year. It placed third behind Tencent (TCEHY) and Sony (SNE), whose gaming revenue was $19.7 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively, reports Newzoo. Apple and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) generated $9.5 billion and $6.9 billion in gaming revenue last year, respectively.","['microsoft', 'xbox', 'sales', 'revenue', 'gaming', 'users', 'moves', 'content', 'trouble', 'respectively', 'live', 'billion', 'business']","Microsoft wants to create a safe space for gaming discussionsMicrosoft (MSFT) is aiming to moderate content that people post to its Xbox Live platform, in an apparent attempt to keep its gaming business out of trouble.

4,"Google cut off Huawei’s access to Android

Microsoft (MSFT) has removed Huawei laptops from its online store, according to CNN. The decision is viewed as a response to the Trump administration blacklisting Huawei on charges the company poses a national security risk. As a result, US companies are barred from selling software or components to Huawei. Google (GOOGL) responded to the restrictions by cutting off the Chinese company’s access to its Android operating system.

Microsoft could follow suit by cutting Huawei’s access to its Windows ecosystem. Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERIC), which compete with Huawei for 5G telecom equipment contracts, are seen as potential beneficiaries of Huawei’s US troubles.

The cost of cutting business ties with Huawei

Huawei, one of the world’s top smartphone companies, beat Apple to become the world’s second-largest smartphone company in the first quarter, according to IDC. It held 19% of the market in terms of unit sales. Samsung (SSNLF) held the largest share, with 23.1% of the global smartphone market, and Apple came third with 11.7%. Huawei smartphones run Android software. Given Huawei’s position as one of the world’s top smartphone companies, Google’s Android business could suffer due to Huawei being dropped as a customer.

Although Microsoft could lose Windows revenue after cutting ties with Huawei, the damage would likely be limited as Huawei is not a major player in the laptop market. In the March quarter, Microsoft’s Windows revenue rose year-over-year to $4.9 billion from $4.6 billion.","['microsoft', 'companies', 'cutting', 'android', 'access', 'windows', 'market', 'smartphone', 'google', 'worlds', 'joins', 'huawei', 'huaweis']","Google cut off Huawei’s access to AndroidMicrosoft (MSFT) has removed Huawei laptops from its online store, according to CNN.
