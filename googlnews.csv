At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.80% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through July 1, 2019. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

1,"Google’s advertising revenue rose 15%

Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google will refund its advertisers whose campaigns ran on sites with invalid traffic, according to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal. It’s unclear what this refund will cost Google, but it will certainly come as a financial loss for the company.

Google generated advertising revenue of $30.7 billion in the first quarter, representing an increase of 15.4% YoY (year-over-year). Advertising revenue increased 26% YoY at Facebook (FB), 18% YoY at Yandex (YNDX), 6.0% YoY at Yelp (YELP), and 3.0% YoY at Baidu (BIDU) in the quarter.

Advertising contributed 85% of total revenue at Google’s parent, Alphabet, in the first quarter.

Facebook considered refunding advertisers

Facebook, which derives most of its revenue from advertising, also explored refunding its advertisers following global outages on its advertising platforms that resulted in lost exposure for advertisers. Facebook’s platforms, from its namesake social network to Instagram, have suffered global outages lasting for as long as a day in recent months. Google and Facebook are the world’s top digital advertising providers.

As the world’s leading digital advertising platforms grapple with traffic fraud and service outages, which can cost the marketers that choose to advertise with them, some advertisers are threatening actions that could hurt their bottom lines. As Bloomberg reported last month, Procter & Gamble (PG) has threatened to cut ad spending on platforms that can’t guarantee the transparency and brand safety it wants. PG is one of the world’s top corporate advertisers.","['advertisers', 'revenue', 'advertising', 'traffic', 'yoy', 'platforms', 'outages', 'google', 'worlds', 'refunding', 'yelp']","Google’s advertising revenue rose 15%Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google will refund its advertisers whose campaigns ran on sites with invalid traffic, according to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal.

3,"Probe relates to Google’s ad practices

Ireland’s privacy watchdog is investigating whether Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has violated the European Union’s new data privacy law, which came into effect a year ago. The probe focuses on how Google handles people’s personal data for advertising purposes. Ireland is Google’s leading European regulator because that’s where the company’s headquarters for its EU operations are located.

If the probe finds no fault in how Google handles people’s data, then that would be great news for the company and its shareholders. But if the probe reveals a problem, Google will be in trouble. The data privacy law that EU countries adopted in May 2018 empowers privacy regulators in the region to impose fines of up to 4.0% of a company’s global sales for serious violations.

Google risks $2.9 billion financial blow

A 4.0% fine on Google’s 2018 revenue would mean a $2.9 billion bill for the company. That would be a massive financial blow to Google, which is trying to make every dollar count as it works to expand and diversify its business. Google is spending billions of dollars on capex on real estate purchases and data center construction as it works to expand its cloud computing capacity to better compete with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) for revenue in the cloud market. Google finished the first quarter with a ~7.0% share of the global cloud market, far behind Amazon’s 35% and Microsoft’s 15%.

Google is also investing big in growing its hardware business, which makes products such as smart speakers. The company captured an 18% share of the global smart speaker market in the first quarter compared to 21.7% for Amazon, 15.8% for Baidu (BIDU), and 14.1% for Alibaba (BABA), according to data from Strategy Analytics.

Google’s parent, Alphabet, finished the first quarter with $113.5 billion in its cash reserve.","['privacy', 'risk', 'quarter', 'global', 'googles', 'probe', 'heres', 'irish', 'company', 'opens', 'market', 'cloud', 'google', 'data', 'faces']","Probe relates to Google’s ad practicesIreland’s privacy watchdog is investigating whether Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has violated the European Union’s new data privacy law, which came into effect a year ago.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google.

We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Noncontrolling interests are not presented separately as the amounts are not material. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Unaudited Interim Financial Information

The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019 , the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 , the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 , the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 are unaudited. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2019 , our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 , and our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 . The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 .

These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 , as amended, filed with the SEC.

Use of Estimates

Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debt allowance, sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) ""Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We will adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. We are currently evaluating new credit loss models and updating our processes and controls in preparation for the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The effect on our consolidated financial statements will largely depend on the composition and credit quality of our investment portfolio and the economic conditions at the time of adoption.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) ""Leases."" Topic 842 supersedes the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, ""Leases."" Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating.

We adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. The most significant effects of Topic 842 were the recognition of $8.0 billion of operating lease assets and $8.4 billion of operating lease liabilities and the de-recognition of $1.5 billion of build-to-suit assets and liabilities. We applied Topic 842 to all leases as of January 1, 2019 with comparative periods continuing to be reported under Topic 840. In the adoption of Topic 842, we carried forward the assessment from Topic 840 of whether our contracts contain or are leases, the classification of our leases, and remaining lease terms. Our accounting for finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The standard does not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 4 for further details.

Prior Period Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Performance fees have been reclassified for all periods from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net to align with the presentation of the investment gains and losses on which the performance fees are based. See Note 13 for further details.

Equity Investments

The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method.

Marketable equity securities

Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.

The following table summarizes marketable equity securities measured at fair value by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 (in millions):

(1) Includes an investment that was reclassified from non-marketable equity securities following the initial public offering of the issuer.

Non-marketable equity securities

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.

The following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities (in millions, unaudited):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2019 Unrealized gains $ 2,511

Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2019 Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 387

$ 42

Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period (1) 2,644

1,041

Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 3,031

$ 1,083





(1) Includes $2,488 million and $390 million related to non-marketable equity securities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 , respectively.

In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. The cumulative net gain measured as the sale price less the initial purchase price for equity securities sold during the period ending March 31, 2019 was $118 million .

Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method

Equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 . Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.

We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as discussed below. Any components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged item.

We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.

We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $327 million and $518 million , respectively, which was included in other current assets.

Cash Flow Hedges

We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.

For forwards and option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. We reflect the gains or losses of a cash flow hedge included in our assessment of hedge effectiveness as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify these gains and losses to revenues when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions





13

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.





become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net.

As of March 31, 2019 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $113 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.

Fair Value Hedges

We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.0 billion as of both December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 .

Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items.

Net Investment Hedges

We use forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $6.7 billion and $ 7.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively.

Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts was $20.1 billion and $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively.

Note 4. Leases

We have entered into operating and finance lease agreements primarily for data centers, land and offices throughout the world with lease periods expiring between 2019 and 2063 .

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2019. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in operating lease





17

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.





liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Operating lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with our lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.

Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed, however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.

Components of operating lease expense were as follows (in millions, unaudited):

Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 398

Variable lease cost 128

Total operating lease cost $ 526

As of March 31, 2019 , we have entered into leases, primarily for data centers, land and offices, that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $4.4 billion that are not reflected in the table above. These leases will commence between 2019 and 2022 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 20 years.

Note 5. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

Consolidated VIEs

We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect their economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.

For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $2.4 billion and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $909 million and $786 million , respectively.

Calico

Calico is a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan.

In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico entered into a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In the second quarter of 2018, AbbVie and Calico amended the collaboration agreement resulting in an increase in total commitments. As of March 31, 2019 , AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement and is committed to an additional $500 million which will be paid by the fourth quarter of 2019. As of March 31, 2019 , Calico has contributed $500 million and has committed up to an additional $750 million .

Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies share costs and profits for projects covered under this agreement equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico.

As of March 31, 2019 , we have contributed $480 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to fund up to an additional $750 million on an as-needed basis and subject to certain conditions.

Verily

Verily is a life science company with a mission to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. In December 2018, Verily received $900 million in cash from a $1.0 billion investment round. The remaining $100 million was received in the first quarter of 2019. As of March 31, 2019 , Verily has received an aggregate amount of $1.8 billion from sales of equity securities to external investors. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions and no gain or loss was recognized.

Unconsolidated VIEs

Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the equity method are VIEs. These entities' activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these VIEs were $705 million and $665 million as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date. We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in them.

Other unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 .

Note 6. Debt

Short-Term Debt

We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 .

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.





Long-Term Debt

Google issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in three tranches (collectively, 2011 Notes) in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2014 Notes) in February 2014 due in 2024.

In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024 (collectively, the Google Notes). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity. Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.

In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2016 Notes) due 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinate to the outstanding Google Notes.

The total outstanding long-term debt is summarized below (in millions):

The effective interest yields based on proceeds received from the outstanding notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 were 3.734% , 3.377% , and 2.231% , respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. We may redeem these notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was approximately $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Credit Facility

As of March 31, 2019 , we have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities which expire in July 2023. The interest rate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 .

Note 8. Acquisitions

During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we completed various acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $79 million . In aggregate, $39 million was attributed to intangible assets, $41 million was attributed to goodwill, and $1 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed . These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $15 million .

Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.

For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the three months ended March 31, 2019 , patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 3.7 years and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.0 years.

Antitrust Investigations

On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us.

On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results and ads, to which we responded on August 27, 2015. On July 14, 2016, the EC issued a Supplementary SO regarding shopping search results and ads. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ( $2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. While under appeal, the fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine.

On April 20, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding certain Android distribution practices. We responded to the SO and the EC's informational requests. On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ( $5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018. While under appeal, the fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fine.

On July 14, 2016, the EC issued an SO regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search (AFS). We responded to the SO and to the EC's informational requests. On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AFS partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ( $1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AFS agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. We plan to appeal the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. The fine is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), and the Korean Fair Trade Commission have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In November 2016, we responded to the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. On February 8, 2018, the CCI issued its final decision, including a fine of approximately $21 million , finding no violation of competition law infringement on most of the issues it investigated, but finding violations, including in the display of the “flights unit” in search results, and a contractual provision in certain direct search intermediation agreements. We have appealed the CCI decision. The fine was accrued for in 2018.

Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to





24

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.





change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.

In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for an en banc rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.

Other

We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.

Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.

With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.

Non-Income Taxes

We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.

Note 11. Stockholders' Equity

Share Repurchases

In January 2018, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $8.6 billion of its Class C capital stock, which was completed during the three months ended March 31, 2019. In January 2019, the





25

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.





board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $12.5 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.7 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $3.0 billion .

Note 13. Compensation Plans

Stock-Based Compensation

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 , total stock-based compensation (SBC) expense was $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion , respectively, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively.

As of March 31, 2019 , there was $23.6 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years .

Performance Fees

We have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns. We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 , performance fees of $632 million and $117 million , respectively, primarily related to gains on equity securities (for further information on gains on equity securities, see Note 3) were accrued and recorded as a component of other income (expense), net. Performance fees for prior periods have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net to conform with current period presentation. For further information see Note 1 .

Note 14. Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 was 10.8% and 18.3% , respectively. The increase is primarily due to a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the gains on equity securities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the non-deductible EC fine in the three months ended March 31, 2019 .

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and partially offset by the impact from the EC fine that is not tax deductible.

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and the effects from a release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the gains on equity securities.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively. Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 , respectively.

For information regarding non-income taxes, see Note 10 .

Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.

Our reported segments are:

• Google – Google includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings.

• Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X, among others. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Access as well as licensing and R&D services through Verily.

Revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented separately, as these amounts are immaterial. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.

6,"AT&T (T -1% ) has confirmed heavy changes to its DirecTV Now streaming service, The Verge notes, with added HBO but higher prices and the removal of several popular channels for new subscribers.

The company announced yesterday it was readying two bundles for launch at $50/month and $70/month. But the $50 plan is now the most expensive base plan of the five rivals in the streaming live TV space (which includes Hulu with Live TV, PlayStation Vue (SNE +1% ), Sling TV (DISH -0.3% ) and YouTube TV (GOOG +0.4% , GOOGL +0.7% )).

And while the company's adding HBO to the new plans, it's dropping channels from AMC Networks (AMCX -3.3% ), Viacom (VIA -1.4% , VIAB -2.2% ) and Discovery (DISCA -2.3% ), including HGTV, A&E, MTV, TLC and Nickelodeon, among others. Shares in those companies are dropping quickly.

Existing customers will be able to keep their current plans, but those with HBO will need to pay $15/month now rather than $5/month, a move that will serve to push them to one of the two new offerings.

Of the five streaming-live TV rivals, only Sling continues to offer the Viacom networks.
